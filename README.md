# Powershell-Pranks
A short compilation of simple Powershell pranks

To use these prank programs, simply copy the code from the files, go to your windows start menu and type in Powershell ISE. In Powershell
ISE click 'New File' in the top left corner and copy and paste the code into the file. You should then be able to press 'F5' or the green
triangle at the top center of your screen to run the program. Just a reminder: beware where and how long you run some of these programs for some programs may or may not freeze or crash your computer.
