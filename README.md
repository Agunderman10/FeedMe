# Powershell-Pranks
A short compilation of simple Powershell pranks

#### To use these prank programs:
 * Simply copy the code from the files, go to your windows start menu and type in Powershell ISE. In Powershell
   ISE click 'New Script' in the top left corner and copy and paste the code into the file. You should then be able to press 'F5' or the      green triangle at the top center of your screen to run the program. 

 * Or, if you have Git installed, you can just clone these programs into your own local repos and run them from there. 

Just a reminder: beware where and how long you run some of these programs for some programs may or may not freeze or crash your computer.
